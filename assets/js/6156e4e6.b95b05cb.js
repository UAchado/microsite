In terms of the user perspective, the Authentication epic is done.\\n\\nThe Authentication epic was the first epic we concluded in the project. However, it does not mean the others are too behind. The remaining epics have approximately 2 to 3 stories to be done, so they can be concluded.\\n\\nNow the focus of our team aims to conclude the merging phase, so we can have a fully operational product and start testing its usability with real-life users. Since the user\'s interactivity is the major key to our project\'s success, we intend to make this product available as soon as possible.\\n\\nBesides, the technical details, we also enhanced our marketing techniques reaching a larger group of interested users, who eagerly await to have access to and use your product and its valuable functionalities.\\n\\n## Sprint Burndown\\n\\n![Sprint 4 Burndown](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1153266163522994188/1179835261987848312/image.png?ex=657b3a36&is=6568c536&hm=4af807b1872ddeebb9c6db51f25cae967f16f537093fa82fa6443e813d4845b7&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=2566&height=1026)"},{"id":"Sprint 3","metadata":{"permalink":"/microsite/blog/Sprint 3","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-13-sprint_3/sprint_3.md","title":"Sprint 3","description":"From: 30/10/2023","date":"2023-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 13, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":3.085,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Pinto","url":"https://github.com/Pjnp5","imageURL":"https://github.com/Pjnp5.png","key":"paulo"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Sprint 3","title":"Sprint 3","authors":["paulo"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Sprint 4","permalink":"/microsite/blog/Sprint 4"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sprint 2","permalink":"/microsite/blog/Sprint 2"}},"content":"**From**: 30/10/2023\\n\\n**To**: 13/11/2023\\n\\n**Scrum Master:** Paulo Pinto\\t\\n\\n**Product Owner:** Daniel Ferreira\\n\\n**Developers:** Miguel Matos, Raquel Paradinha, Tiago Carvalho\\n\\n## Sprint Planning\\n\\n\\nIn order to complete this sprint, it is expectable to conclude the following goals:\\n\\n- UAC-5 Attach Tags to Found Items\\n- UAC-6 Marking Item as \'Retrieved\'\\n    - UAC-64 Create endpoint that changes an item state to retrieved\\n    - UAC-65 Create an interface to change the item state to retrieved\\n- UAC-15 Attach Photos to Found Items\\n    - UAC-50 Setup images storage\\n    - UAC-66 Create endpoint that stores the image on the item storage\\n- UAC-16 Archiving Retrieved Items\\n    - UAC-67 Create a trigger to archive retrieved items after a predefined time  \\n- UAC-29 Finish Report on Found Item\\n    - UAC-48 Create POST for report by Personnel\\n    - UAC-49 Create interface for submit and process report by personnel\\n- UAC-54 Implement CD Pipelines\\n- UAC-56 Create Terraform script to provision infrastructure\\n- UAC-59 Geolocate a Pickup Point\\n    - UAC-68 Connect project with google maps API\\n    - UAC-69 Create an interface that shows the location of the user and of the pickup point selected\\n- UAC-60 Redirect to Pickup Point\\n- UAC-61 Filter Lost Items\\n    - UAC-62 Create GET endpoint to get items by tag\\n    - UAC-63 Upgrade interface to get the items filtered by tag\\n\\n\\nCompleted goals:\\n\\n- UAC-5 Attach Tags to Found Items\\n- UAC-6 Marking Item as \'Retrieved\'\\n    - UAC-64 Create endpoint that changes an item state to retrieved\\n    - UAC-65 Create an interface to change the item state to retrieved\\n- UAC-16 Archiving Retrieved Items\\n- UAC-29 Finish Report on Found Item\\n    - UAC-48 Create POST for report by Personnel\\n    - UAC-49 Create interface for submit and process report by personnel\\n- UAC-59 Geolocate a Pickup Point\\n    - UAC-68 Connect project with google maps API\\n    - UAC-69 Create an interface that shows the location of the user and of the pickup point selected\\n- UAC-61 Filter Lost Items\\n    - UAC-62 Create GET endpoint to get items by tag\\n    - UAC-63 Upgrade interface to get the items filtered by tag\\n\\n\\nIncompleted goals:\\n\\n- UAC-15 Attach Photos to Found Items\\n    - UAC-50 Setup images storage\\n    - UAC-66 Create endpoint that stores the image on the item storage\\n- UAC-54 Implement CD Pipelines\\n- UAC-56 Create Terraform script to provision infrastructure\\n- UAC-60 Redirect to Pickup Point\\n- UAC-67 Create a trigger to archive retrieved items after a predefined time  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Expected | Quantity |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Story Points: | 9 |\\n| Epics: | 0 |\\n\\n\\n## Sprint Review\\n\\n\\n| Concluded| Quantity |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Story Points: | 7 |\\n| Epics: | 0 |\\n\\n## Sprint Retrospective\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis sprint saw the team navigate through a complex set of deliverables, juggling between advancing our product features and addressing emergent tasks from other disciplines.
