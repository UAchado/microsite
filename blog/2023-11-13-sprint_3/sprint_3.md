## Sprint Retrospective




This sprint saw the team navigate through a complex set of deliverables, juggling between advancing our product features and addressing emergent tasks from other disciplines. The completed goals represent major strides in improving our service offerings and user satisfaction.

Moving forward, we must prioritize the completion of the pending tasks while ensuring that the team has clear focus areas without overextension. We will also seek to enhance our collaboration with other disciplines to ensure that external demands do not derail our sprint goals.

In the next sprint, we aim to close the gaps in image management and infrastructure provisioning, finalize our CD pipelines, and refine our item redirection and archiving processes.

We also plan to initiate the development of a Secure Login and Authentication system to personalize and secure user experience,
develop a Notifications System to keep users informed and engaged with real-time updates and implement a Proximity-Based Item Search feature to enhance the efficiency of item retrieval based on user location.
