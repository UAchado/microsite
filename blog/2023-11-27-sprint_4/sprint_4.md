## Sprint Retrospective

This sprint was one of the best sprints we had, both in terms of story point delivery as well as team cooperation. In terms of the user perspective, the Authentication epic is done.

The Authentication epic was the first epic we concluded in the project. However, it does not mean the others are too behind. The remaining epics have approximately 2 to 3 stories to be done, so they can be concluded.

Now the focus of our team aims to conclude the merging phase, so we can have a fully operational product and start testing its usability with real-life users. Since the user's interactivity is the major key to our project's success, we intend to make this product available as soon as possible.

Besides, the technical details, we also enhanced our marketing techniques reaching a larger group of interested users, who eagerly await to have access to and use your product and its valuable functionalities.
