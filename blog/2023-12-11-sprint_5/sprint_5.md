## Sprint Retrospective

During this sprint, we focused on finishing up the functionality of the application, and solidify the deployment and instantiation of infrastructure.

Overall, we managed to deliver a greater part of the user stories we had planned for this sprint. However, we didn't manage to completely finish all tasks. The most problems came from the infrastructure instantiation mechanisms and the attempt at integrating with Cognito.

In the end, we feel like we underestimated the amount of effort that needs to be put into the final steps of the project. We had a lot of unexpected problems, such as constant CORS issues.
