# Actors

### Description

In the context of user stories, an **"actor"** is the person who performs the actions described within the story. This actor is commonly referred to as *"a [type of user]"* in the user story format, serving the purpose of clarifying the intended recipient and the actions they are expected to undertake. This approach enhances the team's understanding of the user story's requirements.

## Our actors

We defined 2 actors for our project:

### Regular user

This user is someone who uses the app to find the items they lost.

### Autorized Security

This user is responsible for recieving the items that are found and putting them on the system, as well as delivering them when the owner appears to pick it up and alter the item status.
