# Definition of Done

### Description

In agile software development, the "Definition of Done" (DoD) is a crucial set of criteria that must be met before considering a product increment, like a user story or feature, as complete and ready for release. This definition ensures the team's confidence in delivering high-quality software. To begin with, our team mutually defined the specific criteria and parameters that constitute our DoD.


## Our definition

1. Meets all story acceptance criteria.

2. Successfully passes functional tests if applicable.

3. Clears the predefined quality gate.

4. PR reviewed and approved by a different team member.

<!-- 5. Developer documentation updated or added in Docusaurus. -->
