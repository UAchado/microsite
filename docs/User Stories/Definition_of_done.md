# Definition of Done

### Description

In agile software development, the "Definition of Done" (DoD) is a crucial set of criteria that must be met before considering a product increment, like a user story or feature, as complete and ready for release. This definition ensures the team's confidence in delivering high-quality software. To begin with, our team mutually defined the specific criteria and parameters that constitute our DoD.


## Our definition

1. Acceptance criteria are clear and defined.

2. All dependencies are identified and planned for.

3. Story has been sized or estimated by the team.

4. Requirements are clear with no ambiguities.

5. A basic feasibility check is completed.

6. UI/UX mockups provided if applicable.
