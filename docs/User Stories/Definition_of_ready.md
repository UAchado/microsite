# Definition of Ready

A user story is deemed ready for work when all the criteria outlined in the definition of ready (DoR) have been met. 
This signifies that a user story is in a state of preparedness for the team to start working on it. Adhering to these 
criteria ensures that user stories are clearly defined and poised for team action, ultimately enhancing the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the development process and leading to the delivery of higher-quality software.

## Our definition

1. The user story is independent.

2. Acceptance criteria is defined.

3. Requirements are well defined. 

4. The cost of the story has been estimated by the team.


## Story Points

Story points are a way to estimate the amount of effort required to complete a user story in our product backlog. 
So, to better organize the work to be done, before the start of each sprint we evaluated our stories.

| Almost nothing                   | Few             | Few days             | 5            |
