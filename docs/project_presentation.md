# UAchado

## Brief Project Explanation


The "UAchado" is a project designed for the University of Aveiro community. Its primary goal is to virtualize and simplify 
the traditional lost and found process by providing a user-friendly, digital solution. This innovative platform will serve 
as a central repository where every item recovered and safely stored within the university premises is meticulously documented 
and made easily accessible to its rightful owners.

By harnessing the power of technology, this initiative not only enhances the efficiency of the lost and found system but 
also ensures that students, faculty, and staff can conveniently reclaim their belongings through a user-friendly interface, 
ultimately fostering a stronger sense of community and accountability within the university campus. This project is set to 
streamline and modernize the process of reuniting individuals with their lost items, reducing frustration, and enhancing the 
overall campus experience.
